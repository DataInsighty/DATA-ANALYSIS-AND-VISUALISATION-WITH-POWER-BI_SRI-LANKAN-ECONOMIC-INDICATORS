# Data Analysis and Visualization with Power BI: Sri Lankan Economic Indicators

# Overview
This project examines Sri Lanka’s socio-economic data across 13 categories, spanning from 2000 to 2022. Using Power BI, the data was transformed into interactive dashboards and visualizations to uncover trends, relationships, and areas of concern within the country’s economic landscape. Insights from this analysis are designed to support policy makers, businesses, and researchers in understanding Sri Lanka's economic trajectory.

# Key Features and Findings
## Dataset Overview:
Covers 13 socio-economic indicators: GDP, Consumer Price Index (CPI), external trade, government finance, exchange rates, total debt, and more.
Source: Asian Development Bank (ADB) Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific 2023.

## Key Transformations:
Eliminated unnecessary columns and rows.

Fixed inaccuracies and null values.

Created new calculated metrics: Total debt in LKR.

Revenue and expenditure as a percentage of GDP.

Balance of trade metrics.

## Major Insights:
GDP Growth: Consistent upward trend until 2019, followed by a decline in 2020 due to the pandemic, with recovery thereafter.
Services dominate GDP contributions; agriculture shows a steady decline.

Government Finance: Expenditure consistently exceeds revenue, with a growing gap since 2019.
Government expenditure doubled compared to revenue by 2022.

External Trade: Negative balance of trade persists, with import costs consistently exceeding export values.
Trade activities were significantly affected by COVID-19 in 2020.

Exchange Rate: LKR’s value against USD has seen consistent depreciation, with sharp increases in 2018 and 2022.

Inflation (CPI): Gradual increase since 2013, with a dramatic 46% surge in 2022.

Total Debt: Exponential growth since 2010, correlating strongly with GDP and government borrowing.

# Recommendations
Enhance Export Competitiveness: Provide subsidies for export-oriented industries to reduce the negative balance of trade.
Introduce policies to strengthen domestic supply chains and reduce production costs.

Address Inflation: Implement monetary policies to curb excessive money supply growth.
Encourage investments that enhance productivity and stabilize consumer purchasing power.

Optimize Government Finance: Prioritize revenue generation through effective taxation strategies.
Control expenditure growth to narrow the fiscal deficit.

Mitigate Debt Growth: Explore sustainable borrowing mechanisms to manage growing debt.
Invest in projects that yield long-term economic benefits to offset debt burdens.

Strengthen Currency Stability: Implement exchange rate management strategies to stabilize LKR value against USD.
